## Creating Assets

There are a series of assets that each serial needs:

+ Serial Cover Landscape Large
+ Serial Cover Landscape Large Sale
+ Serial Cover Landscape Coming Soon
+ Serial Cover Landscape Small
+ Serial Cover Landscape Small Sale
+ Serial Cover Landscape Coming Soon
+ Serial Cover Portrait Large
+ Serial Cover Portrait Large Sale
+ Serial Cover Portrait Coming Soon

+ Author Headshots

There is a serial template for creating these assets in the dropbox. It lives here [assets/templates/serial_assets.psd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxlxz1jilrqlmpv/serial_assets.psd?dl=0). In this file you'll find dimensions for all the assets and you can easily export from here. 

## Platypus

Serials are configured as `Volumes` and `Issues` via the [Platypus CMS](https://platypus.29.io/) provided by 29th Street Publishing.
  

### Previewing Content
You can preview a serial without releasing it by visiting the preview URL: `https://dev.serialbox.com/serials/SERIAL_ID/preview`
 
The Episode ID can be found by going to the Article page in Platypus and copying the ID in the URL which comes after `/issue/`, e.g. The ID for the URL `https://platypus.29.io/#/issue/555d1163ada6e26d95b9e785` would be `555d1163ada6e26d95b9e785`.
 
This will bypass the cache for this single page load.
 
Please note, the episode number will be wrong, but you can check the formatting, share links etc.

### Web Application
1. Refresh the Development cache: [dev.serialbox.com/refresh](http://dev.serialbox.com/refresh)
2. Refresh the Production cache: [www.serialbox.com/refresh](http://www.serialbox.com/refresh)

When you go the links above you will be asked for a login, these are in the "Serial Box project wiki"

7. Go to Issues
8. Go into the relevant Serial Issue e.g. `Bookburners`
9. Paste the List ID into the List ID field
10. Click `Save`

### Testimonials Text

Testimonials need to be formatted in a particular way to ensure they're style consistently across Serials.


{% highlight html %}
<div> <blockquote>“Bookburners is sheer enormous fun! More soon please.”­</blockquote><h3>- Naomi Novik</h3><p>author of Uprooted and the Temeraire series</p></div>
{% endhighlight %}

### Authors Text

Authors need to be formatted in a particular way to ensure they're styled consistently across Serials.

{% highlight html %}

  <div class="img">

#### Authors Page

The Authors are also shown on the [Authors page](http://www.serialbox.com/authors). Some authors contribute to multiple Serials, to ensure they don't show up multiple times on the Authors page you can add the class `authors-page-hide` to the surrounding div. e.g:
{% highlight html %}
<div class="authors-page-hide">
  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://serialbox.cachefly.net/bookburners/authors/headshot_goldstone.jpg">

  <p>Bio/Descrpiton</p>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Intro text can be styled with the following HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<p>Paragraph of text</p>
