## Creating Assets

There are a series of assets that each serial needs:
+ Serial Cover Landscape Large
+ Serial Cover Landscape Large Sale
+ Serial Cover Landscape Small
+ Serial Cover Landscape Small Sale
+ Serial Cover Portraint Large
+ Serial Cover Portraint Large Sale
+ Chapter Divider
+ Author Headshots

There is a serial template for creating these assets in the dropbox. It lives here [assets/templates/serial_assets.psd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxlxz1jilrqlmpv/serial_assets.psd?dl=0). In this file you'll find dimensions for all the assets and you can easily export from here. 

## Platypus

Serials are configured as `Volumes` and `Issues` via the [Platypus CMS](https://platypus.29.io/) provided by 29th Street Publishing.
  

### Previewing Content
You can preview a serial without releasing it by visiting the preview URL: `https://dev.serialbox.com/serials/SERIAL_ID/preview`
 
The Episode ID can be found by going to the Article page in Platypus and copying the ID in the URL which comes after `/issue/`, e.g. The ID for the URL `https://platypus.29.io/#/issue/555d1163ada6e26d95b9e785` would be `555d1163ada6e26d95b9e785`.
 
This will bypass the cache for this single page load.
 
Please note, the episode number will be wrong, but you can check the formatting, share links etc.

### Updating information in the applications

EacCh application caches the content from the 29th Street API so when you update information in the Platypus CMS you must do the following to trigger it to update in the applications:

#### iOS Application
1. Increment the Version number for the relevant "Volume" for this Serial.

### Web Application
1. Refresh the Development cache: [dev.serialbox.com/refresh](http://dev.serialbox.com/refresh)
2. Refresh the Production cache: [www.serialbox.com/refresh](http://www.serialbox.com/refresh)

When you go the links above you will be asked for a login, these are in the "Serial Box project wiki"

### Testimonials Text

Testimonials need to be formatted in a particular way to ensure they're style consistently across Serials.


{% highlight html %}

{% endhighlight %}

### Authors Text

Authors need to be formatted in a particular way to ensure they're styled consistently across Serials.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="authors-page-hide">
  <div class="img">
    <img src="http://serialbox.cachefly.net/bookburners/authors/headshot_goldstone.jpg">
