## CMS

The web application has been setup with [Comfortable Mexican Sofa](https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa).
 
The CMS will create pages off the root of the website, therefore it is your responsibility to ensure you don't set a URL structure that is already being used in the application. To help ensure this, here is a list of URLs we're currently using:
 
+ `/serials`
+ `/episodes`
+ `/account`
+ `/about`
+ `/how-it-works`
+ `/authors`
+ `/help`
+ `/blog`
+ `/app`
+ `/signup`
+ `/logout`
 
If you choose a URL structure that is already being used, the existing page will be shown and your created page will not be shown.

### Creating a page
 
1. Go to the CMS admin go to: [serialbox.com/admin](https://www.serialbox.com/admin)
2. Click on `Pages`
3. On the 'Root' line click `Add Child Page`
4. Enter a label â€” This is only displayed in the admin
5. Confirm you're happy with the `slug`. This will be the URL. e.g. a slug of `sign-up-page` will generate the URL `https://www.serialbox.com/sign-up-page`
6. Select a layout
7. Enter the custom fields
8. Click `Preview` to view the page without publishing
9. Click `Create Page` to publish the page

### Sign Up Layout

A Sign up layout has been created to allow easy creation of landing pages for marketing campaigns to drive sign ups to a given MailChimp mailing list.
 
The following fields have been made available:
 
+ List: This is the MailChimp List ID found on the Settings > List Name and Defaults page within MailChimp
+ Page title: This is the title of the page, shown in the browser tab
+ Title: This is the title shown below the Serial Box logo
+ Text: This is the text displayed underneath the above title
+ Form title: This is the title displayed directly above the sign up form
+ Success title: This is the title of the message shown when the form is submitted successfully
+ Success text: This is the text below the above title shown when the form is submitted successfully
 
You can use `&lt;br&gt;` and `&lt;a&gt;` tags within the fields, but do not use `&lt;p&gt;` or `&lt;h&gt;` tags.
