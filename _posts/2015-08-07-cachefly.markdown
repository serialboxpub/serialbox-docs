Cache Fly is used to host all media and assets used in both the web and iOS applications.
 
The assets are generally referenced in the Platypus CMS as the full URL.
 
Login details for Cache Fly can be found in the Project Wiki.
 
## FTP Client
Cachefly uses an FTP server to facilitate uploading files. We recommend you [download Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.en.softonic.com/mac/download) to use as an FTP client.

## URL Structure
Cachefly sets up everything in your FTP folder at the URL `http://serialbox.cachefly.net/`, therefore any folders or files you create will be accessible after the base URL.
 
For example, if you create a `bookburners` folder and inside that put a file called `cover.jpg`, this will be available at http://serialbox.cachefly.net/bookburners/cover.jpg`.

## Example: PDF Upload
1. Name the PDF file something like `bookburners1.pdf`
2. Login to Cache Fly at https://portal.cachefly.com/portal/login
3. Click `ftp.cachefly.com` next to FTP Server on the Control Panel home
4. This will open your FTP client (Cyberduck if you have it installed)
5. Open or create a folder for the Serial e.g. `Bookburners`
6. Open or create a folder called `ebooks`
7. Drag and drop the PDF file int the `ebooks` folder
8. Wait for the upload to complete
9. Test the URL e.g. `http://serialbox.cachefly.net/bookburners/ebooks/bookburners1.pdf`
10. Copy and paste the URL into the relevant field in Platypus
