## Share Text

We have built a mini-templating system to allow customisation of the share texts used throughout both applications without having to deploy.

### Share URLs

The type of share URL used is set to a specific field, but this field can be changed via the Platypus CMS.
  
The following Share URLs are used:
 
+ Serial: `Serial Short URL`
+ Reading Episode: `Episode Short URL`
+ End of Episode: `Serial Short URL`

### Serial variables
+ `{SERIAL_TITLE}`: Will output the title e.g. `Book burners`
+ `{SERIAL_STRAPLINE}`: Will output the strapline e.g. `Some books have teeth`
+ `{SERIAL_HASHTAG}`: Will generate and output a hashtag based on the title e.g. `#Bookburners`

### Episode variables

+ `{EPISODE_NUMBER}`: Will output the number e.g. `2`
+ `{EPISODE_TITLE}`: Will out the title e.g. `Badge, Book, and Candle`
+ `{EPISODE_STRAPLINE}`: Will output the strapline e.g. `Detective Sally Brooks investigates an unusual robbery, and discovers that magic is realâ€”and hungry!`

### Exmaple
Custom field text: `{SERIAL_STRAPLINE}. {SERIAL_HASHTAG}. Get caught up:`
 
Output: `Some Books Have Teeth. #Bookburners. Get caught up:`

### Updating Share Text

Whenever you change the share text fields, you need to change the Version number of the relevant Volume. For example, if you change the share text for an episode of Bookburners, you need to update the Bookburners Volume `version` by 1 and Re-Publish it.
